# Tiny Python Utils

A collection of tiny python-based utility functions. Each function is contained within it's own directory and usually exposes a very simple command-line interface. Each directory also contains a seperate `README.md` along with the standard `requirements.txt` file for required dependencies.

It is recommended that a virtual Python environment is setup for each utility, to isolate conflicting dependency versions if and where they occur.
